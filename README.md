ArtificialIntelligence
======================
I took the course in Spring 2012.
This course is detailed on the Wash U website at http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kilian/cse511a/index.html. I worked in a team of two people on all of the projects (except project 0 which was a Python tutorial).

There were four project topics: state-space search, multi-agent search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. In each project, we implemented general-purpose AI algorithms in Python and then integrated them into the Pac-Man world using search heuristics, evaluation functions, and feature functions, in order to achieve goals in the game, such as collecting all the food and avoiding ghosts.
